Project: Flight Booker
In this project, you’ll get a chance to tackle some more advanced forms. This is the kind of thing you’ll have to work with when handling user orders for anything more complicated than an e-book. In this case, we’ll build the first three steps of a typical checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

A typical airline booking flow:

Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
Choose from among a list of available flights
Enter passenger information for all passengers
Enter billing information
Step 4 would be done via integration of something like Paypal, via a gem or an SDK or Stripe.

Assignment
We’ll be creating a one-way flight booker. You’ll get lots of practice populating and building dropdown menus, radio buttons, and nested submissions. Let the fun begin!
